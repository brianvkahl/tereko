Two diseases caused by these entities can be distinguished by the Pulvinar sign on FLAIR sequence. One type of these entities, HET-S, is found in <em>Podospora</em>, while URE3 and PSI+ are types of these agents found in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>. Conversion from the “C” isoform to an “Sc” isoform of (*)</strong> PrP creates these agents. One disease caused by these agents causes elevated levels of 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid. Stanley Prusiner won the Nobel Prize for researching these entities that cause fatal familial insomnia, scrapie in sheep, and kuru among the cannibalistic Fore people. For 10 points, name these infectious and misfolded proteins that cause diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and mad cow.",

One multiplies by the Jacobian determinant to change (*)</strong> variables while performing this operation. Certain types of this operation require the norm of the normal vector and a parameterized function. One may change the order in which this operation is performed by Fubini’s theorem, and Stokes’s theorem relates the surface and line types of this operation. One method of approximating this operation uses quadratic equations and is named for Simpson. Often approximated by Riemann sums, for 10 points, name this operation that can find the area under a curve and is the counterpart of differentiation.",

This phenomenon explains the strong downfield shift of aromatic compounds' ring currents in proton NMR. A normal conductor cooled into superconducting state displays the (*)</b>) perfect form of this phenomenon, with a susceptibility of negative one. This phenomenon occurs if all electrons in a material are paired. This behavior could be used to accomplish levitation because it causes materials to repel all B fields.

Given its value at the center of mass, it can be calculated for the same object about a parallel axis. This quantity equals torque divided by angular acceleration, as well as angular momentum divided by angular velocity. For 10 points, name this quantity symbolized I, the rotational analog of mass.",
