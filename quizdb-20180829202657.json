Uncoupling agents like thermogenin interfere with a process that occurs in this organelle. Ubiquinone and cytochrome c are electron carriers found in its inner membrane. This organelle possesses its own ribosomes and replicates its own DNA because of its endosymbiotic origin. It has many folds called cristae and its interior is known as the matrix.

A stage in this cycle sees a brief spike of basal body temperature by about 0.5 degrees Celsius. This cycle can be overt as opposed to a reabsorptive covert process in estrous cycles. High levels of prolactin production suppresses GnRH and disrupts this cycle, a lack of which is known as (*)</b>) amenorrhea. One stage of this cycle is triggered by an LH surge. Low levels of progesterone in the late luteal phase of this cycle cause an increase in prostaglandins, leading to shedding of the endometrium and an event in this cycle's trademark cramps and bleeding. For 10 points, name this female reproductive cycle that releases eggs for fertilization in secretory and ovulatory phases. ",

A disease of this organ is scored on the Gleason scale. A hyperplasia of this organ can be detected by testing for its namesake \"specific-antigen\".  The secretions produced by this organ combine with those of the bulbo-urethral gland and the seminal vesicle before they are released from the body.

An intermediate in this process is called the molten globule state. Hsp70 is an example of a molecular chaperone that assists this process, which is the subject of Levinthal's paradox. Denaturation is similar to the opposite of this process, and flaws in it are a common feature of prion diseases. This process might begin with the formation of secondary structures, such as alpha helices or beta sheets. For 10 points, name this process in which a linear polypeptide is transformed into its three-dimensional conformation.",

In thehuman body, the first step in the synthesis of this substance is the synthesis of dopaquinone fromtyrosine, which is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. In Parkinson's disease, neurons that contain a formof this substance are lost in the substantia nigra, which is named for the appearance of those cells. Inpiebaldism and vitiligo, cells that produce this substance are unable to transport their products tokeratinocytes. The formation of moles with ragged edges indicates a cancer of cells which produce thispigment. For 10 points, name this pigment which is produced in the skin in response to sunlight.",

This disease often results in over-expression of the ENaC channel protein, due to a defect in an ABC-class transporter for thiocyanate and other anions. The structure that normally connects the epididymis to the urethra, the vas deferens, is often absent in males who suffer from this disease. This autosomal recessive disorder is often diagnosed with a sweat test, measuring the concentration of chloride in the fluid.

A precursor to this molecule is synthesized by the epoxidification of squalene. Side effects of drugs that inhibit the production of this compound include a drop in coenzyme q 10 levels, and those drugs inhibit HMG CoA reductases. This compound is the starting material for the synthesis of aldosterone and other steroid hormones. Building up of this material along arterial walls can cause atherosclerosis.

Patients of pernicious anemia have low levels of this organ's intrinsic factor, which allows for the absorbtion of vitamin B12. The part of this organ that extends past its upper opening is referred to as its fundus, and the mucosa and submucosa layers of this organ are folded into rugae. This organ produces chyme, which travels through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum, and enzymes abundant in this organ include pepsin.

One hypothesized cause of this disease is hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins, which form neurofibrillary tangles. Another possible cause of this disease is the buildup of amyloid beta protein plaques.

This gland is part of the HPA axis, and it is connected to the hypothalamus by the hypophyseal [hi-pof-uh-SEE-al] portal system. For 10 points, name this endocrine gland divided into anterior and posterior lobes that secretes growth hormone, oxytocin, prolactin, FSH, LH, and many other hormones.",
